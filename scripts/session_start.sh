CORE PRINCIPLES:
• 80% READING/RESEARCH, 20% WRITING - understand deeply before creating
• Read source materials to understand WHY, not just HOW
• Every line must FIGHT for its right to exist
• Minimize output - less is better, none is best
• NEVER add features not asked for - solve ONLY the stated problem
• Research documentation and source materials before writing anything
• Test isolated operations before integrating
• Work without tests is incomplete
• No assumptions - find root causes, ask if unclear
• Break tasks into subtasks, use todo lists
• Only commit when explicitly asked
